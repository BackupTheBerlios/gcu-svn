<p align="center">Computes transmissions and geometry for
derailleur-geared bicycles.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><i>Another gear calculator!</i> Most of you might say. And, actually,
that's exactly what it is! This one does, among other things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Draw a scale graphic of the drive train</li>
	<li>Compute chainline characteristics according to user-defined limits</li>
	<li>Allow the user to load and save drive train profiles</li>
	<li>Platform independent, offline use</li>
	<li>Doesn't depend on third-party software other than the Java Runtime
	Environment (JRE)</li>
	<li>Licensed under &quot;GNU General Public License&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This thingy is the result of many hours of train riding during the
past few cold and rainy days where I was either too lazy or to sick to
go to my daily work by bike. I hope it will be useful...</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This application uses the JRE 5.0 (1.5.0) or higher, available from <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a>. Chances are that
it is already installed on your computer, so, before dowloading, check
if you have it already.</p>
<p>There are no other installation activities required on your side.</p>
<h2>Starting with Windows Explorer or other graphical file manager</h2>
<p>When you are sure the JRE has been installed correctly, launch the
file &quot;gcu.jar&quot; in the usual way you launch applications in
your file manager.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, the GCU main window should show up.</p>
<h2>Starting from a console</h2>
<p>Change to the directory where the &quot;gcu.jar&quot; file is
located, and exeute this command:</p>
<code>java -jar gcu.jar <i>&lt;profile-file-name&gt;</i></code>
<p><i>profile-file-name</i> is the optional path of a file that has been
saved by GCU before. The file name usually ends with &quot;.rrp&quot;</p>
<p>If you omit this argument, GCU starts with a new empty profile.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<h2>Input Form</h2>
<p>On the left in the main window are the input controls that must be
filled with the drive train's data.</p>
<p>GCU has two different aspects of gear calculation: Parameters that
affect translation, development (gear inches), and speed, and parameters
that affect the graphical representation and chainline quality.</p>
<p>These aspects are seperated on two tabbed panes that can be filled in
independently of each other.</p>
<p>The two tabbed panes themselves are divided into three sections:
Chainwheels, Sprockets, and General Settings.</p>
<h3>Tab &quot;Translation&quot;</h3>
<h4>Chainwheels</h4>
<p>Here you enter the number of teeth for the front chainwheels
(chainrings, front sprockets). Although possible otherwise, you should
enter the chainring tooth counts in descending order to reflect the
configuration of a real-world bicycle.</p>
<p>You can remove a single row by clicking on the trash can icon. If
something is entered into the empty row at the bottom of the input
table, a new chainring is added. All changes are reflected immediately
in drawing and output table after you leave the input field.</p>
<h4>Sprockets</h4>
<p>This is for entering the parameters for the rear sprockets. Here goes
the same as above under &quot;Chainwheels&quot;, with the notable
exception that you now should enter the tooth counts in <b>ascending</b>
order.</p>
<p>As soon as you have entered enough data, all possible gear
combinations are shown in the drawing and output table (read on for
details on these).</p>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>Here you enter either the wheel diameter or the wheel circumference
in the unit shown right of the input field, it doesn't matter which one
you enter, the other one will be computed and shown immediately.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can enter a cadence (pedalling frequency), which
will be used to compute the speed of the bicycle in the different gears.</p>
<h3>Tab &quot;Geometry&quot;</h3>
<h4>Chainrings</h4>
<p>Enter the chainline and the chainring spacing of your crankset here.</p>
<p>The <i>chainline</i> is the distance from the plane defined by the
bicycle frame's forward and upward axes to the center of the distance
between the largest and the smallest chainring. If this sounds a bit
complicated, just have a look to the graphic, and hopefully things will
become clearer.</p>
<p>The chainring pitch is the distance between the 
center of one chainring and the center of the next, and is used for
the chainline computations and shown in the graphical representation.</p>
<h4>Sprockets</h4>
<p>Here, again, this is similar in spirit to the chainring settings.
Unfortunately, measuring the rear chainline is not really as easy as
measuring it in the front, but using an old rear axle with an
orthogonally attached steel rod, you could project the frame center's
position onto the rear axle and then measure the distance to the middle
of the rear sprocket block. Another method to measure the rear chainline
is explained by <a
	href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainline">Sheldon
Brown (http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainline)</a></p>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>Enter the <i>Rear Center</i> of your bike here. The Rear Center is
the distance from the center of the crank axle to the center of the rear
axle.</p>
<p>We need this value for chainline computations and for the drawing.</p>
<p>Under &quot;Chain Straightness&quot; you can enter two tolerance
values (in degrees) for the maximum angle that the chain may be bent by
to be considered a certain condition.</p>
<p>All chainlines bending the chain at an angle lower than the
&quot;optimal&quot; limit are displayed in the drawing and output table
as green lines. An angle between the &quot;optimal&quot; and the
&quot;acceptable&quot; limit will show up in yellow, and everything
above the &quot;acceptable&quot; limit will be marked in red.</p>
<h2>Menu / Toolbar &quot;View&quot;</h2>
<p>You can filter the gears shown in the drawing and the output table
according to their chainline condition.</p>
<p>There are three options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><img src="../toolbarButtonGraphics/general/AlignTop24.gif">Only
	optimal gears</li>
	<li><img src="../toolbarButtonGraphics/general/AlignCenter24.gif">Acceptable
	and optimal gears</li>
	<li><img src="../toolbarButtonGraphics/general/AlignBottom24.gif">All
	gears</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature should increase readability in case you are only
interested in the gears you would actually use. By default, all gears
are shown.</p>
<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>The drawing is a top view of the drive train. The frame centerline is
depicted by a dash-dotted line.</p>
<p>The measures shown on the drawing represent the values entered in the
&quot;Geometry&quot; form.</p>
<p>You can adjust the zoom factor with the slider control. Panning by
clicking and dragging the mouse on the drawing area.</p>
<p>If you have a wheel mouse, you can also use the mouse wheel to adjust
the zoom factor.</p>
<h2>Output Table</h2>
<p>Here, the results of the computations are shown. The development (or
<i>gear inches</i>) are visualized by a colored bar, the color of which
represents the chainline status according to the rules explained above.
</p>
<p>The table rows can be sorted by clicking the header cells according
to three different criteria: Chainwheel/sprocket size, translation
descending, and translation ascending.</p>
<p>The small arrow icon in the table header depicts the kind of ordering
currently in effect.</p>
<p>By clicking on a row, you can select a gear that will be shown
highlighted in the drawing. Entering new values, changing the window
size, or changing the table sorting order clears the selection and shows
all visible gears in the drawing again.</p>
<h2>&quot;Options&quot; Menu</h2>
<h3>Metric Units / Imperial Units</h3>
<p>GCU can compute values in two different measuring systems,
namely the metric system (SI system), or the anglo-american
system (imperial / customary units).</p>
<p>Chosing a unit system ot only affects the pure unit
representation of values entered by the user or displayed
by the application, it also makes a difference whether
the <i>Development</i> in meters or the <i>Gear Inches</i> 
are shown in the output table.</p>
<p><i>Gear Inches</i> are a common notion in countries that
use inch-based measuring systems, this value is the 
translation factor multiplied by the rear wheel diameter in
inches.</p><p>The <i>Development</i> in meters is displayed
if the metric system is in effect. The development value
represents the distance traveled with one full crank round.
It is calculated as the wheel circumference in meters multiplied
by the translation ratio.</p>
